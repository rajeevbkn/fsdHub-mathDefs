# mathDefs
This repository consits of snippets in Python 3.6.4 or later versions. Some have been relied upon additional packages like math, cmath, matplotlib, scipy and numpy etc.
Subsequent scaling would delve upon Physics formulae.
I have named the files in a self explanatory way so that purpose of each one of them is clear from the title. However, in case of any clarification that might be required or felt necessary, the same may be indicated in the comments please.
This is for my love of Maths & Physics, so enjoy them!
